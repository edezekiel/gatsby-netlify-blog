Welcome to the inaugural post! For my first project, I will walk through how I set up this blog. There are four basic steps: (1) choose your web hosting service, (2) pick a domain name, (3) create an html file, and (4) upload the file.


1. Choose a Web Hosting Service

[Hostingfacts.com](https://hostingfacts.com/) recently published its list of the "10 Best Web Hosting Services in 2018." They listed Bluehost as #1 for best reliability. After doing a bit more research I decided to go with Bluehost.

2. Pick a Domain Name

My next step was picking a domain name (edezekiel.com).

3. Create the HTML File

I used Sublime to create this html file. I named the file "index.html."

4. Upload the HTML File

This step was my biggest hurdle, but I found a great tutorial on youtube at [<span>dancourses</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmfXTnFMuw). Dan explains the cpanel and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) methods for uploading a HTML file. Cpanel is a linux webhost used by Bluehost and other web hosting services. You can log into cpanel by adding "/cpanel" to the end of your website name (e.g., "www.edezekiel.com/cpanel"). FTP creates a connection between a computer and a hosting account. Cpanel got the job done for now, but I will use FTP as my website grows.

Thank you for reading. I have a lot of exciting posts for this blog coming soon, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me.
