If you follow my blog you know that I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and started work as a web developer.

I can't believe I've been on the job about a month already! Here are some of the tips and pitfalls I've come across during my first month.

## React Hooks are Amazing

The first project I worked at at web3devs used React Hooks extensively. Before working at web3devs I had been putting off learning hooks. I didn't see the point of adding Hooks when React already seemed to work fine.

After using hooks for a few weeks, I intend on using them in every React project moving forward. I love being able to forget about class components. My favorite part about JavaScript is the emphasis on functional programming. React hooks do a great job of building on top of this programming style.

I find that my components are more composable, flexible, and fun to use.

## HTML5 has a Built-in API for Form Validation, But Use Cases Are Limited.

If you've ever added `required` to an input field, then you've used HTML5's built-in api for form validation. `required` is a simple way to prevent a user from submitting a form if they, e.g., forgot to enter their email in the form. If the use clicks submit, a standard message will pop up telling the user that the field is required.

However, using the native HTML5 form validation causes some issues when you're working in a react project. Specifically, it gives the browser's DOM control over input fields (making it an uncontrolled component), whereas most react forms should use the virtual DOM (making it a controlled component).

One of my favorite bloggers, [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/react-forms/), eloquently explains the importance of controlled components:

> There are two main ways of handling forms in React, which differ on a fundamental level: how data is managed.
>
> - if the data is handled by the DOM, we call them uncontrolled components
> - if the data is handled by the components we call them controlled components
>
> As you can imagine, controlled components is what you will use most of the time.

Sonny Recio [explains](https://codeburst.io/how-to-use-html5-form-validations-with-react-4052eda9a1d4) that "[w]eâ€™re potentially violating Reactâ€™s design patterns while doing so as weâ€™re accessing the DOM properties using native javascript."

My personal approach is to add `required` to a form input, then use the `.checkValidity()` api in the handleSubmit function.

## Use `git mv` To Rename and Move Files

The toughest bug I've ran into so far was a `git merge` issue caused because I didn't use `git mv`. Using `git mv` to rename and move files lets you be explicit about your intention and helps to avoid some errors.

Here is a fantastic [article on git mv](https://koukia.ca/rename-or-move-files-in-git-e7259bf5a0b7) explaining this issue. And no I didn't find this article until after I resolved the bug. ðŸ˜ž.

## Git projects are case-insensitive by Default.

When you initilize git in a project directory it automatically creates a config file. In that config file, you will see a line that says `ignorecase = true`. This means that if you rename a folder from "Components" to "components", on GitHub the folder will still be called "Components."

This issue came up simultaneously with my `git mv` bug, which lead to some very interesting behavior.
