Time continues to fly at Flatiron bookcamp. We are wrapping up mod two today (Ruby on Rails) and presenting projects.

**Teamwork**

We worked on ruby on rails projects in teams. My partner was Kaeland and I am so glad that we got paired together!

We finally got to flex our Ruby on Rails knowledge. More importantly, we had blast working together. Here's the link our app: [DailyGifs](https://infinite-anchorage-40950.herokuapp.com/).

There were several points during project week where things could have gone sideways. There were some early issues with our domain model, difficult password authentication concepts, and a fair number of styling bugs.

However, Kaeland's upbeat attitude and our teamwork helped us stay in "coding flow" and keep the ball rolling. I am so proud of our final product.

If you are just starting out with learning to code, look for opportunities to work on a team. It's been one of the highlights of the bootcamp so far.

**Our Web App - DailyGif**

If you've made it this far in this blog post, you may be wondering what we actually built! Here's a quick rundown:

- The web app is called DailyGif.
- We wanted to make something that was a cross between [iwastesomuchtime.com](https://iwastesomuchtime.com/) and [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/). In other words, a fun website for people who love gifs!
- DailyGif users can signup, login, view a feed of recently created gifs, and upload gifs.
- We picked Semantic UI for our CSS framework. Even with a framework, it took about a day and a half to work out all the styling kinks.

**Thank You Flatiron!**

Before I wrap up this post, I want to thank all of the instructors and staff at Flatiron in Atlanta. I really appreciate the awesome culture, technical support, and guidance. Thank you!
