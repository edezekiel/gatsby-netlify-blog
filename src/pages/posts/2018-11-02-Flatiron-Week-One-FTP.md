I'm in week one of the Flatiron bootcamp! I'm writing this on Friday afternoon.

My substantive update for this post is that I finally implemented (Safe) File Transfer Protocol. I used a guide from [Indiana University](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akom). SFTP makes uploading the website files much faster.

So much has happened in five days, but here are some of my main thoughts:

- Cohort

  - The first cohort is small.

  - There are 7 other people in cohort (Kwam, Andy, Blair, Cory, Paris, Will, and Kaeland).

- Topics

  - We went straight to Ruby, Git, and Bash.

- Schedule

  - Classes really do run from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.

  - I haven't left campus before 6:30 p.m.

- Homework

  - The instructors deploy new labs after class gets out.

  - We used concepts from those labs the next day.

- Pair Programing

  - We've already used pair programming.

  - Yesterday, we paired up to work on a lab. We learned how pair programming traditionally involves a "navigator" and a "driver," and got the chance to implement this process to solve a lab.

- Active Learning

  - Most of the day is spent on active learning.

  - There are lectures, but they only last for an hour or two in the mornings.

  - We spend the rest of the day working on labs and helping each other out with debugging.
